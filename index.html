            <p class="para">
                My name is Ahmed Karasneh, I was born in 1994 in Irbid city, I have a bachelor's degree in software
                engineering from JUST UNI.
                I graduated in 2019 and then started working at Aspire company as a quility engineer, I worked for
                almost 2 months there and left the job because I was thinking about doing a master degree also in
                software engineering but due to the COVID-19 pandamic I changed my mind and decided to become a
                developer.
                Luckily I got accepted in a schoolership at ASAC Luminus programming bootcamp and started in late
                january till this day.
